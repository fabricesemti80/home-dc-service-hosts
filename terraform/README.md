## PBS CPU from root PAM polling

`proxmox-pbs-0` is the PBS LXC at `10.0.40.16`.

On 2026-07-15, the container reported near-100% CPU. The hot process was
`unix_chkpwd root nullok`, spawned by `proxmox-backup-api`.

Cause: Proxmox storage `pbs-proxmox-backup` was configured as `root@pam`, so
regular PVE storage polling repeatedly hit PBS PAM authentication.

Fix applied:

- created PBS API token `root@pam!pve-storage`
- granted it `DatastoreAdmin` on `/datastore/proxmox-pbs-datastore`
- changed PVE storage `pbs-proxmox-backup` username to `root@pam!pve-storage`
- kept the existing Proxmox storage password file as the token secret

Validation:

- `pvesm status` showed `pbs-proxmox-backup` active from `pve-0`, `pve-1`, and `pve-2`
- PBS CPU dropped back to normal; no hot `unix_chkpwd` process remained

If this regresses, check `/etc/pve/storage.cfg` before tuning PBS resources.
