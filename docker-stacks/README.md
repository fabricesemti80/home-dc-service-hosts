# Docker stacks

Portainer-managed Docker stacks.

## Layout

Each compose file is a separate Portainer GitOps stack. Required variables live
in the repo root `.env` and are listed in `.env.example`.

| Area | Services | Endpoint |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/docker-compose.yml` | Beszel, Uptime Kuma, Whoami, Beszel agent | Swarm; apps pinned to `sentinel-1`, agent global |
| `dashboard/docker-compose.yml` | Homepage | Swarm; pinned to `sentinel-1` |
| `gitops/docker-compose.yml` | Kestra | Swarm; pinned to `sentinel-1` |
| `networking/docker-compose.yml` | Docktail, Technitium primary/secondary | Swarm; Docktail global, DNS pinned per host |
| `monitoring/docker-compose.yml` | Pulse | Swarm manager, constrained to `sentinel-1` |

Services attach to `homelab_proxy`; Swarm stacks require that network to be a swarm-scope overlay network before deployment.

Beszel agent requires `BESZEL_AGENT_KEY`; without it the container exits with
`no key provided`. Docker agents listen on TCP `45876`, matching the host/port
configured in Beszel.

Pulse setup notes live next to the stack in
[`monitoring/README.md`](monitoring/README.md).

Kestra setup lives in `gitops/docker-compose.yml`. It imports the
`homelab.ops` flows on deploy:

- `ordered_shutdown`: refuses to run while PBS backup tasks are active, checks
  Ceph health, stops k8s VMs, stops service guests, sets `noout`, then powers
  off Proxmox hosts.
- `ordered_restart`: waits for Proxmox SSH and Ceph `HEALTH_OK`, clears
  `noout`, starts service guests, then starts k8s VMs.

Both flows default to dry-run.

## HTTPS

App labels expose services via Docktail as native Tailscale Services on port 443 with automatic Tailscale HTTPS certificates, e.g.:

```yaml
labels:
  docktail.service.enable: "true"
  docktail.service.name: whoami
  docktail.service.port: "80"
  docktail.service.service-port: "443"
  docktail.service.protocol: http
```

## Deployment

Portainer GitOps pulls these compose files from this repo. Ansible only
bootstraps Docker, Tailscale, Swarm, and Portainer.
