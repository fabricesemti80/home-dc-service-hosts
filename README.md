# home-dc-service-hosts

Standalone service host lifecycle for the home DC.

## Ownership

This repo owns long-lived VMs and LXCs that are not part of the Proxmox host
platform and not part of the Talos/Kubernetes cluster.

- `home-dc-proxmox`: Proxmox hosts, Ceph, storage, templates, pools, API tokens, backup policy.
- `home-dc-kubernetes`: Talos VMs and Kubernetes lifecycle.
- `home-dc-service-hosts`: standalone service hosts such as Docker nodes, PBS, and Technitium DNS.

## Tooling

Use Terraform for guest lifecycle. It gives a real plan, state, drift detection,
and destroy semantics for VM/LXC resources.

Terraform is run through the official Linux container in `Taskfile.yaml` because
the Darwin `bpg/proxmox` provider can plan locally but fails during apply on
this workstation.

Use Ansible only after provisioning, for inside-guest configuration that cannot
be expressed cleanly as Proxmox resources.

Terragrunt is intentionally skipped for now. Add it only if this grows into
multiple repeated environments.

Tailscale ACLs, split DNS, MagicDNS preferences, and search paths are managed here in Terraform.

## Workflow

```sh
task tf:init
task tf:plan
task tf:apply
task ansible:apply
```

Terraform lives in `terraform/` and Ansible lives in `ansible/`.

Create `.env` from `.env.example`. For now this repo uses Proxmox ticket auth
because privileged LXC feature flags are rejected through API tokens.

Guest notes, including the PBS API-token fix for high CPU from root PAM polling,
live in [`terraform/README.md`](terraform/README.md).

## Ansible

`proxmox_debian_guests` receives the `debian_base` role. Service-specific
groups, such as `proxmox_backup_servers`, add narrow roles on top.

`docker_standalone_hosts` receives Docker, host-level Tailscale, and Portainer
bootstrap. Portainer manages application stacks from `docker-stacks/`.

Pulse configuration notes live in
[`docker-stacks/monitoring/README.md`](docker-stacks/monitoring/README.md).

## Guest Modules

Use `modules/lxc_guest` for containers and `modules/vm_guest` for VMs. Leave
`vlan_id` unset for the host native VLAN; set it only for tagged VLANs.

LXC NFS mounts require privileged containers plus `mount_types = ["nfs"]`.
Changing an existing unprivileged LXC to privileged forces replacement, so PBS
should move to a VM if it needs to own backup storage directly.
